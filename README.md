So this is the text after the test,

I'd like to state that this is unaccaptable work that I did, and I did not plan to fail this test this miserably. If I have the opportunity to continue the intership, I'd like to spend some time with you to fully understand how fetch works, and I have never had experience with working with calling js in html.

I think that's it: Have nice day
